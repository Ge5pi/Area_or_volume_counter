A versatile geometry calculator built with C# Windows Forms that helps calculate areas of 2D shapes and volumes of 3D shapes.

## 🎯 Features
### 2D Shape Calculations:
- Circle Area (πr²)
- Rectangle Area (length × width)
- Triangle Area (Heron's formula)

### 3D Shape Calculations:
- Sphere Volume ((4/3)πr³)
- Parallelepiped Volume (length × width × height)
- Cone Volume ((πr²h)/3)
- Cylinder Volume (πr²h)
- Pyramid Volume ((base area × height)/3)

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- Built using C# Windows Forms
- Dynamic UI that adapts based on selected shape
- Input validation for all calculations
- Clean separation of UI logic between forms
- Precise mathematical calculations using Math class

## 💻 Usage
- Launch the application
- Select calculation type (2D/3D)
- Choose the desired shape
- Enter required measurements
- Click "Calculate" to get the result

## 🧮 Supported Calculations
- Circle: Uses π × radius²
- Rectangle: Simple length × width calculation
- Triangle: Implements Heron's formula for area
- Sphere: Implements (4/3)π × radius³
- Parallelepiped: Uses length × width × height
- Cone: Calculates (π × radius² × height)/3
- Cylinder: Uses π × radius² × height
- Pyramid: Calculates (base area × height)/3
